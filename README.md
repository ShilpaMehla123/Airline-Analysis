## 📈 Objectives of Analysis

Using Python (pandas, matplotlib, seaborn), this project answers the following questions:

1. What are the airlines in the dataset, along with their frequencies?
2. Bar graphs showing the **Departure Time** & **Arrival Time** distributions
3. Bar graphs showing the **Source City** & **Destination City** distributions
4. Does ticket price vary with different airlines?
5. Does ticket price change based on the departure time and arrival time?
6. How does price change with change in Source and Destination?
7. How is the price affected when tickets are bought just 1–2 days before departure?
8. How does ticket price vary between Economy and Business class?
9. What is the average price of  flights from  to  in Business class?
